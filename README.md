# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

# Notes from Educators
This repository is the starter code for the project: Students will fork and clone this repository, then build upon it to practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express back-end skills. 

# Opening statment form the student, AKA Russel Mueller!
This is the second major project I have taken of this relative size and scope. The focus of this project was to both learn and make use of Jquery, CSS, HTML, and ajax. Both ajax and jquery were more intuitive for me to learn and therefore I feel I implemented them into this project better than i did for both CSS and HTML, aLthough the project does run to spec as outlined by educators. There are plans to work on and possibly release version 1.1.0 December 2022, with a focus on refactoring CSS and HTML and making use of SASS.
